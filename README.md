# Project Description

## Project Overview
Esports has rapidly gained popularity over the past decade, with professional gamers and competitive gaming tournaments now offering substantial earnings potential. This data analysis project aims to explore and understand the trends in esports earnings using data visualization and statistical analysis. We will utilize Jupyter Notebooks along with Python libraries such as Seaborn, Matplotlib, and NumPy to achieve our objectives.

## Project Objectives

Data Collection: Gather relevant data on esports earnings, including earnings by players, teams, games, and tournaments. This data may be collected from publicly available sources, APIs, or datasets.

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Perform data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure data quality and consistency. This may involve handling missing values, data type conversions, and data normalization.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conduct an in-depth exploratory data analysis to understand the distribution, central tendencies, and basic statistics of esports earnings. Visualize key insights using Seaborn and Matplotlib to identify trends, outliers, and patterns.

Earnings by Game Analysis: Analyze the earnings of professional gamers and teams, focusing on specific games. Identify the top-earning players and teams, and visualize their earnings over time.

Tournament Analysis: Investigate the relationship between esports earnings and tournaments. Determine which tournaments offer the highest prize pools and analyze the distribution of earnings among participants.
